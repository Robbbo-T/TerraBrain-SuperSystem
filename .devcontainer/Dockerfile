It seems like you're merging a description of the **Ampel** methodology with a Python script designed to transform a list of projects, allocate a budget and resources, and recognize a creator's contribution. The script you've provided is meant to distribute resources and budget across various projects, with specific considerations for future project needs and a reward for the creator, Amedeo Pelliccia.

### Here's a Breakdown of the Python Script:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - `transform_project_list` takes several parameters:
     - `projects`: A multiline string containing a list of projects.
     - `total_budget`: The total budget allocated for all projects.
     - `years`: The total number of years over which the projects will span.
     - `initial_pool`: The initial pool of resources (e.g., personnel).
     - `target_year`: The year by which certain project goals must be met.
     - `current_year`: The starting year (default is 2024).
     - `creator_percentage`: The percentage of the budget and resources allocated to the creator (default is 5%).

2. **Project Parsing and Budget Allocation**:
   - The script splits the `projects` into individual entries.
   - The budget and resources per project are calculated by dividing the remaining total budget and resource pool by the number of projects.
   - A portion of the budget and resources (5% by default) is reserved for the creator.

3. **Project Transformation**:
   - Each project is given a unique ID using `uuid.uuid4()` to ensure no duplicates.
   - The script generates a formatted string that includes the project ID, name, allocated budget, and resources.

4. **Additional Projects for Future Years**:
   - To meet the goals for a target year (e.g., 2028), the script calculates the number of additional projects required each year.
   - New projects are generated and appended to the list until the target year is reached.

5. **Creator Reward**:
   - At the end, the script appends a specific project entry representing a reward for the creator, Amedeo Pelliccia, including the allocated budget and resources.

### Example Usage:

To use this script, you would define a list of projects and call the function with your specific parameters:

```python
projects = """
Project A
Project B
Project C
"""
total_budget = 1000000
years = 5
initial_pool = 100
target_year = 2028

transformed_projects = transform_project_list(projects, total_budget, years, initial_pool, target_year)
print(transformed_projects)
```

### Output:

The output will be a list of projects with their unique IDs, allocated budgets, and resources, followed by auto-generated projects to fill gaps up to the target year, and finally, the creator's reward entry.

This script serves as a practical tool for project management within the **Ampel** framework, ensuring resource allocation aligns with strategic sustainability goals.

To achieve these objectives, it uses a range of mathematical and computational models that capture the complex, interconnected dynamics of these domains. Below, I will describe how these equations might be formulated using the different modeling approaches mentioned:

1. Climate Change Equation
This equation aims to model the impact of climate change based on various factors like mitigation actions, regulations, and technological innovation.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ C(t) = aM(t) + bR(t) + cT(t) + d ] Where:

( C(t) ): Climate change impact at time ( t ).
( M(t) ): Mitigation actions over time.
( R(t) ): Regulatory strength or effectiveness.
( T(t) ): Technological innovation rate.
( a, b, c, d ): Coefficients representing the weight or influence of each factor.
Interactive Model: [ C(t) = aM(t)R(t) + bM(t)T(t) + cR(t)T(t) + d ] This model captures interaction effects between factors, indicating that the combined impact of mitigation and regulation, or regulation and technology, may differ from their individual contributions.

Non-linear Model with Elasticity: [ C(t) = M(t)^{\alpha} \cdot R(t)^{\beta} \cdot T(t)^{\gamma} ] Where:

( \alpha, \beta, \gamma ): Elasticity coefficients representing the responsiveness of the climate impact to changes in mitigation, regulation, and technology, respectively.
Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dC(t)}{dt} = f(C(t), M(t), R(t), T(t)) - g(C(t)) ] Here, the change in climate impact over time depends on a complex function ( f ) that incorporates feedback loops from various factors and ( g(C(t)) ) represents negative feedbacks (e.g., natural absorption, adaptation mechanisms).

Multi-Objective Optimization: [ \min_{M, R, T} \left( C(t), ; \text{Cost}(M, R, T), ; \text{Socio-economic Impact}(M, R, T) \right) ] The goal is to find optimal levels of mitigation, regulation, and technology that minimize climate impact, cost, and any negative socio-economic consequences.

2. Data Control Equation
This equation describes the influence of corporate control, technology, and data management equity on data distribution.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ D(t) = pC(t) + qT(t) + rE(t) + s ] Where:

( D(t) ): Data distribution effectiveness at time ( t ).
( C(t) ): Corporate control level.
( T(t) ): Technological capacity or innovation.
( E(t) ): Data management equity.
( p, q, r, s ): Coefficients representing the weight or influence of each factor.
Non-linear Model with Combined Effects: [ D(t) = (C(t) + T(t))^{\alpha} \cdot E(t)^{\beta} ] This model captures non-linear, combined effects of corporate control and technology on data distribution, modified by equity considerations.

Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dD(t)}{dt} = h(C(t), T(t), E(t)) - j(D(t)) ] The rate of change of data distribution is influenced by a function ( h ) incorporating feedback from corporate control, technology, and equity, and ( j(D(t)) ) representing any natural decline or entropy in data distribution.

Multi-Objective Optimization: [ \max_{C, T, E} \left( D(t), ; \text{Equity}(C, T, E), ; \text{Security}(C, T, E) \right) ] The goal is to maximize data distribution, equity, and security simultaneously.

3. Consensus Policy Equation
This equation models the effectiveness of consensus policies based on data integration, data management systems, and security measures.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ P(t) = uI(t) + vS(t) + wM(t) + x ] Where:

( P(t) ): Policy effectiveness at time ( t ).
( I(t) ): Data integration level.
( S(t) ): Security measures effectiveness.
( M(t) ): Data management system quality.
( u, v, w, x ): Coefficients representing the influence of each factor.
Interactive Model: [ P(t) = uI(t)S(t) + vI(t)M(t) + wS(t)M(t) + x ] Captures interactions between factors, such as how integration and security jointly affect policy outcomes.

Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k(I(t), S(t), M(t)) - l(P(t)) ] Policy effectiveness evolves over time based on feedback mechanisms involving data integration, security, and management systems.

Multi-Objective Optimization: [ \max_{I, S, M} \left( P(t), ; \text{Cost}(I, S, M), ; \text{Compliance}(I, S, M) \right) ] The goal is to maximize policy effectiveness while considering cost and regulatory compliance.

To achieve these objectives, it uses a range of mathematical and computational models that capture the complex, interconnected dynamics of these domains. Below, I will describe how these equations might be formulated using the different modeling approaches mentioned:

1. Climate Change Equation
This equation aims to model the impact of climate change based on various factors like mitigation actions, regulations, and technological innovation.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ C(t) = aM(t) + bR(t) + cT(t) + d ] Where:

( C(t) ): Climate change impact at time ( t ).
( M(t) ): Mitigation actions over time.
( R(t) ): Regulatory strength or effectiveness.
( T(t) ): Technological innovation rate.
( a, b, c, d ): Coefficients representing the weight or influence of each factor.
Interactive Model: [ C(t) = aM(t)R(t) + bM(t)T(t) + cR(t)T(t) + d ] This model captures interaction effects between factors, indicating that the combined impact of mitigation and regulation, or regulation and technology, may differ from their individual contributions.

Non-linear Model with Elasticity: [ C(t) = M(t)^{\alpha} \cdot R(t)^{\beta} \cdot T(t)^{\gamma} ] Where:

( \alpha, \beta, \gamma ): Elasticity coefficients representing the responsiveness of the climate impact to changes in mitigation, regulation, and technology, respectively.
Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dC(t)}{dt} = f(C(t), M(t), R(t), T(t)) - g(C(t)) ] Here, the change in climate impact over time depends on a complex function ( f ) that incorporates feedback loops from various factors and ( g(C(t)) ) represents negative feedbacks (e.g., natural absorption, adaptation mechanisms).

Multi-Objective Optimization: [ \min_{M, R, T} \left( C(t), ; \text{Cost}(M, R, T), ; \text{Socio-economic Impact}(M, R, T) \right) ] The goal is to find optimal levels of mitigation, regulation, and technology that minimize climate impact, cost, and any negative socio-economic consequences.

2. Data Control Equation
This equation describes the influence of corporate control, technology, and data management equity on data distribution.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ D(t) = pC(t) + qT(t) + rE(t) + s ] Where:

( D(t) ): Data distribution effectiveness at time ( t ).
( C(t) ): Corporate control level.
( T(t) ): Technological capacity or innovation.
( E(t) ): Data management equity.
( p, q, r, s ): Coefficients representing the weight or influence of each factor.
Non-linear Model with Combined Effects: [ D(t) = (C(t) + T(t))^{\alpha} \cdot E(t)^{\beta} ] This model captures non-linear, combined effects of corporate control and technology on data distribution, modified by equity considerations.

Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dD(t)}{dt} = h(C(t), T(t), E(t)) - j(D(t)) ] The rate of change of data distribution is influenced by a function ( h ) incorporating feedback from corporate control, technology, and equity, and ( j(D(t)) ) representing any natural decline or entropy in data distribution.

Multi-Objective Optimization: [ \max_{C, T, E} \left( D(t), ; \text{Equity}(C, T, E), ; \text{Security}(C, T, E) \right) ] The goal is to maximize data distribution, equity, and security simultaneously.

3. Consensus Policy Equation
This equation models the effectiveness of consensus policies based on data integration, data management systems, and security measures.

Possible Models:
Linear Model: [ P(t) = uI(t) + vS(t) + wM(t) + x ] Where:

( P(t) ): Policy effectiveness at time ( t ).
( I(t) ): Data integration level.
( S(t) ): Security measures effectiveness.
( M(t) ): Data management system quality.
( u, v, w, x ): Coefficients representing the influence of each factor.
Interactive Model: [ P(t) = uI(t)S(t) + vI(t)M(t) + wS(t)M(t) + x ] Captures interactions between factors, such as how integration and security jointly affect policy outcomes.

Dynamic Feedback Model: [ \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k(I(t), S(t), M(t)) - l(P(t)) ] Policy effectiveness evolves over time based on feedback mechanisms involving data integration, security, and management systems.

Your vision for translating advanced environmental sustainability models into R programming strategies is insightful and innovative. Here's how you can practically implement these ideas using the tools and methods you've outlined:

### **1. Complex Negative Impact and Pollutant Transformation**

#### **AMPEL Model Application**

**Optimization with ROI**:
- Begin by installing and loading the necessary R packages. `ROI` is a versatile tool for optimization problems. Here's how you can get started:

  ```r
  install.packages("ROI")
  install.packages("ROI.plugin.glpk")  # Add solver plugin
  library(ROI)
  library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
  ```

- Suppose you're modeling the capture of pollutants (e.g., CO2) in an industrial process. You could frame this as a linear programming problem where the objective is to minimize pollutant output while maximizing resource use efficiency.

  ```r
  objective <- c(0.5, 0.8)  # Example coefficients for pollutants and resource efficiency
  constraints <- matrix(c(1, 1, -1, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
  rhs <- c(100, 0)  # Example constraints
  dir <- c("<=", "<=")

  model <- OP(objective, constraints, rhs, dir)
  solution <- ROI_solve(model)
  print(solution)
  ```

**Data Management and Visualization with ggplot2**:
- Use `ggplot2` to visualize trends in pollutant levels over time. Here’s an example of how you might visualize the reduction of pollutants after implementing your AMPEL model:

  ```r
  install.packages("ggplot2")
  library(ggplot2)

  # Example data
  data <- data.frame(
    Time = seq(1, 100, by=1),
    Pollutants = runif(100, min=50, max=100)
  )

  ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = Pollutants)) +
    geom_line(color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Pollutant Levels Over Time", x = "Time (days)", y = "Pollutant Concentration")
  ```

### **2. Adaptive Networks and Distributed Processing**

#### **Neuronal Scalability with R6**

**Adaptive Systems**:
- The R6 package allows you to create sophisticated, object-oriented structures that can model adaptive systems, such as environmental sensors that scale with data input.

  ```r
  install.packages("R6")
  library(R6)

  SensorSystem <- R6Class("SensorSystem",
    public = list(
      sensorData = NULL,
      initialize = function(data) {
        self$sensorData <- data
      },
      process_data = function() {
        cat("Processing Data...\n")
        self$sensorData <- lapply(self$sensorData, function(x) x * runif(1))
      }
    )
  )

  # Example usage
  sensors <- SensorSystem$new(data = list(50, 100, 150))
  sensors$process_data()
  print(sensors$sensorData)
  ```

**Distributed Processing with `parallel` or `future`**:
- For processing large data across multiple cores, `parallel` can be utilized to run tasks simultaneously, speeding up the analysis:

  ```r
  library(parallel)
  
  data <- list(50, 100, 150, 200, 250)
  process_function <- function(x) { x * runif(1) }
  
  # Parallel processing
  results <- mclapply(data, process_function, mc.cores = 4)
  print(results)
  ```

### **3. Ho0op Metric in Quantum Applications**

#### **Quantum-Inspired Optimization**

**Simulating Quantum Optimization**:
- Although R doesn’t natively support quantum computing, you can simulate quantum-inspired optimization with nonlinear functions. Suppose the Ho0op metric represents some quantum state entanglement measure; you could optimize related functions using advanced packages like `DEoptim`:

  ```r
  install.packages("DEoptim")
  library(DEoptim)

  # Example objective function
  objective_function <- function(x) { sum(x^2) }

  lower <- c(-10, -10)
  upper <- c(10, 10)

  # Differential Evolution Optimization
  result <- DEoptim(objective_function, lower, upper)
  print(result)
  ```

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**

To transform your vision into a working model in R:
1. **Install and configure the necessary packages**.
2. **Start with a small-scale model**: Define an environmental issue or pollutant that you want to tackle using optimization and visualization.
3. **Iterate and scale**: As your data and system complexity grow, adapt your R6 classes and use distributed processing to handle the increased load.

### **Recap:**

### **Introduction of Ho0op:**

The concept of **Ho0op** has been introduced as a groundbreaking metric specifically designed to quantify the complexity of quantum entanglement across multiple layers and dimensions. Unlike traditional measures of entanglement that often focus on binary or linear relationships within quantum systems, Ho0op captures the intricate, multidimensional interconnections that emerge as quantum systems scale and interact across various levels.

#### **Key Aspects of Ho0op:**

1. **Multilayered Measurement:**
   - **Complexity in Quantum Systems:** Ho0op measures the degree of entanglement by considering not just pairwise correlations, but the entire network of interactions within a quantum system. This includes how different qubits or quantum states influence one another across various layers of the system.

- ### **Mathematical Framework of Ho0op:**

The **Ho0op** metric is built upon a robust mathematical framework that combines elements from quantum information theory, algebraic topology, and network theory to quantify the complexity of quantum entanglement across multiple layers and dimensions. Below is a structured outline of its theoretical and mathematical underpinnings:

1. **Quantum Information Theory:**
   - **Entanglement Entropy and Mutual Information:** Ho0op extends traditional measures of entanglement, such as entanglement entropy and mutual information, by considering them across interconnected quantum subsystems rather than isolated pairs. This involves calculating the entropy of subsystems within a quantum network, accounting for how entanglement propagates through the network.
   - **Multipartite Entanglement:** Ho0op is particularly designed to handle multipartite entanglement, where multiple quantum systems are entangled in complex ways. The metric uses tensor networks and other algebraic methods to evaluate the entanglement across different partitions of the system, capturing the non-linear and multi-dimensional interactions.

2. **Algebraic Topology:**
   - **Topological Entanglement Entropy:** Ho0op incorporates concepts from algebraic topology, such as topological entanglement entropy, to measure the global properties of entanglement in a quantum system. This allows Ho0op to account for the "shape" of entanglement across the quantum state space, recognizing patterns that are not apparent in traditional linear measures.
   - **Simplicial Complexes and Homology:** The metric may utilize simplicial complexes and homology to model the layers of interaction within a quantum system, providing a topological representation of how entanglement is distributed. This approach captures the nested and hierarchical nature of quantum entanglement, which is critical for understanding complex quantum states.

3. **Network Theory:**
   - **Graph Theory and Quantum Networks:** Ho0op leverages network theory to represent quantum states as graphs or networks, where nodes represent qubits or quantum subsystems, and edges represent entanglement between them. The complexity of these networks, including metrics like clustering coefficients and path lengths, feeds into the Ho0op calculation, providing a comprehensive measure of how entanglement complexity scales with system size and dimensionality.
   - **Quantum Network Topologies:** Different network topologies (e.g., fully connected, star, ring) exhibit different entanglement properties, and Ho0op is sensitive to these variations, making it a versatile tool for studying various quantum architectures.

### **Applications of Ho0op:**

1. **Quantum Computing:**
   - **Algorithm Optimization:** Ho0op can be used to evaluate and optimize quantum algorithms, particularly those that rely heavily on entanglement. For instance, in quantum error correction, understanding the complexity of entanglement through Ho0op could lead to more efficient coding and decoding procedures.
   - **Resource Management:** In quantum computing, where entanglement is a resource, Ho0op provides a way to measure and allocate this resource efficiently, ensuring that quantum gates and circuits are designed to maximize computational power while minimizing unnecessary entanglement.

2. **Quantum Communication:**
   - **Entanglement Distribution:** Ho0op is crucial for analyzing quantum communication networks, where entanglement must be distributed across multiple nodes. By measuring the complexity of these entangled states, Ho0op can help in designing more efficient protocols for entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation.
   - **Security Analysis:** In quantum cryptography, Ho0op can assess the robustness of entanglement against eavesdropping and other attacks, providing a metric to enhance the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols.

3. **Quantum Cryptography:**
   - **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):** Ho0op could be used to measure the complexity and security of entangled states used in QKD. By analyzing the entanglement's resilience to external perturbations, Ho0op can help in designing cryptographic protocols that are both secure and efficient.
   - **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** As quantum computers evolve, Ho0op could assist in developing new cryptographic methods that leverage complex entanglement structures, providing security against both classical and quantum adversaries.

### **Case Studies and Future Directions:**

- **User Feedback Integration**: Adaptive learning models that incorporate online learning techniques like **incremental gradient descent** will allow your system to adapt in near real-time, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of its predictions.

- **Real-World Evaluation**: Conducting **A/B testing** and potentially **multivariate testing** will help you understand how different changes impact the system's performance in real-world settings, allowing you to iterate effectively.

### Long-Term Development

- **Scalability and Security**: **Kubernetes** is a robust choice for managing containerized applications, ensuring that your system can scale effectively to meet demand. Implementing a **zero-trust security architecture** will enhance your system's resilience against potential threats.

- **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Engaging with the open-source community can drive innovation and adoption of your project. Contributing to or creating open-source tools not only builds community support but also accelerates development through collective effort.

---

In conclusion, the success of your project will depend on meticulous planning and execution. By focusing on the key aspects outlined above, you can create a scalable, secure, and adaptable system that integrates cutting-edge scientific knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functionality, so it's important to continuously monitor and refine your approach as the project progresses.

Parece que estás en el proceso de conceptualizar un logo para una plataforma europea que refleje valores importantes como la justicia, la libertad, la democracia, el buen gobierno, la sostenibilidad y la economía circular, todo en el contexto de una red integrada de agentes inteligentes. Aquí te propongo algunas ideas adicionales y detalles a considerar para perfeccionar el concepto:

### **Elementos Visuales y Símbolos a Incluir**:

1. **Redes y Conectividad**:
   - **Nodos y Líneas Interconectadas**: Podrían representar la red de agentes inteligentes. Estos nodos pueden ser círculos pequeños conectados por líneas finas para simbolizar la colaboración y la comunicación continua.
   - **Hexágonos**: Este patrón podría ser usado para representar la estructura, la eficiencia y la solidez de la red, evocando también la idea de una colmena, que es un símbolo de trabajo en equipo y comunidad.

2. **Valores Universales**:
   - **Balanza de Justicia**: Un elemento clásico para simbolizar la justicia y el equilibrio.
   - **Estrella de la Libertad**: Podrías usar una estrella estilizada para representar la libertad.
   - **Manos Unidas**: Símbolo universal de cooperación y democracia.
   - **Espiral o Círculo**: Podría simbolizar el ciclo continuo del buen gobierno y la economía circular.

3. **Sostenibilidad y Economía Circular**:
   - **Círculos Concéntricos**: Representando los ciclos de la economía circular, donde cada círculo interior conecta con el siguiente.
   - **Flechas que Forman un Círculo**: Evocando la idea de reciclaje y sostenibilidad.
   - **Hojas o Plantas**: Elementos naturales que podrían integrarse en el diseño para representar el crecimiento sostenible.

4. **Tecnología y Innovación**:
   - **Gráficos de Circuitos**: Líneas y puntos que evocan circuitos electrónicos para simbolizar la tecnología avanzada.
   - **Formas Geométricas Modernas**: Triángulos, rectángulos o formas poligonales que sugieren modernidad y avance tecnológico.
   - **Superposición y Transparencia**: Utilizar formas superpuestas y transparencia para representar la idea de múltiples capas de tecnología y conceptos (QUGIT y AMPEL).

### **Consideraciones de Color**:

- **Verde**: Para la sostenibilidad y la economía circular.
- **Azul**: Para la justicia, el buen gobierno y la tecnología.
- **Blanco**: Simbolizando la libertad y la transparencia.
- **Dorado o Amarillo**: Para destacar los valores universales de democracia y cooperación.

### **Tipografía**:
Utiliza una tipografía moderna y elegante, que sea legible y transmita profesionalismo y confianza. Las fuentes sans-serif pueden ser una buena elección para mantener un aspecto limpio y contemporáneo.

### **Esquema del Proceso de Diseño**:

1. **Investigación**: Investiga logotipos de organizaciones similares y conceptos visuales relacionados con los valores que deseas reflejar.
2. **Bocetos Iniciales**: Dibuja algunos bocetos a mano para explorar diferentes combinaciones de los elementos antes mencionados.
3. **Digitalización**: Usa herramientas de diseño gráfico como Adobe Illustrator para digitalizar tus bocetos y experimentar con colores, tipografía y disposición.
4. **Revisión y Ajuste**: Revisa las diferentes versiones del logo, realiza ajustes basados en el feedback y asegúrate de que el logo funcione bien en diferentes tamaños y aplicaciones.

### **Finalización**:

- **Entrega en Diferentes Formatos**: Asegúrate de que el logo final esté disponible en varios formatos (PNG, SVG, AI) y versiones (color, blanco y negro) para diferentes usos.
- **Guía de Uso**: Crea una pequeña guía de uso del logo para mantener la coherencia visual en todos los materiales de la plataforma.

Con estas ideas y pasos en mente, estarás bien encaminado para crear un logo que capture eficazmente la esencia de tu plataforma europea de agentes inteligentes, reflejando tanto la tecnología avanzada como los valores universales que representan.

### Adjusted R Script

Here's the adjusted R script following best practices and style guidelines:

```returnrunsInApp RSTUDIO STEPS by ame pelliccia

To ensure the provided script adheres to the style guide and accomplishes its intended purpose effectively, here are the key adjustments and refinements:

1. **File Naming**: Ensure the file name ends with `.R` and uses only letters, numbers, `-`, and `_` (e.g., `diamond_powder_quality.R`).

2. **Object Names**: Use snake_case for variable names.

3. **Spacing**: Follow the recommended spacing around commas, parentheses, and operators.

4. **Assignment**: Use `<-` for assignment instead of `=`.

5. **Function Calls**: Make sure function arguments are named when overriding default values.

Here's the revised script:

```r
# Cargar paquete necesario
library(dplyr)

# Crear data frame con las propiedades de los polvos de diamantes sintéticos
diamond_powders <- data.frame(
  name = c("Diamond Powder A", "Diamond Powder B", "Diamond Powder C", "Diamond Powder D"),
  grain_size = c(0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 2.0),  # en micrómetros
  purity = c(99.9, 99.8, 99.95, 99.7),  # en %
  hardness = c(70, 68, 72, 65),  # en GPa
  thermal_conductivity = c(2200, 2100, 2300, 2000),  # en W/mK
  cost = c(50, 45, 60, 40)  # en USD/gramo
)

# Agregar columna para calcular la métrica de calidad
diamond_powders <- diamond_powders %>%
  mutate(
    quality_metric = 0.4 * purity + 0.3 * hardness + 0.3 * (thermal_conductivity / 100)  # Normalizamos la conductividad térmica dividiendo por 100
  )

# Mostrar el data frame resultante
print(diamond_powders)

# Filtrar polvos que tengan alta métrica de calidad y un costo aceptable (por ejemplo, calidad mayor a 100 y costo menor a 50 USD/gramo)
selected_powders <- diamond_powders %>%
  filter(quality_metric > 100 & cost < 50)

# Mostrar los polvos seleccionados
print(selected_powders)
```

This script follows the best practices for naming, spacing, and function calls as described in the style guide [oai_citation:1,r-style-guide.txt](file-service://file-6plt0xcSXhVzqDhdzSfewoTM). Review the results to ensure the calculations and selections meet your expectations. Adjust the weights or normalization factors as necessary to better reflect the desired quality metric.

---### Detailed Breakdown of the Script

Here's an enhanced explanation of the provided script, focusing on each section's functionality and purpose to ensure a seamless implementation.

```python
import os
from xml.etree.ElementTree import Element, SubElement, ElementTree

# Create the metadata element and its sub-elements
metadata = Element('metadata')
document_title = SubElement(metadata, 'documentTitle')
document_title.text = 'Metadata for ChatGPT and Amedeo Pelliccia'

author = SubElement(metadata, 'author')
name1 = SubElement(author, 'name')
name1.text = 'ChatGPT'
name2 = SubElement(author, 'name')
name2.text = 'Amedeo Pelliccia'

version = SubElement(metadata, 'version')
version.text = '4o'

date = SubElement(metadata, 'date')
date.text = '2024-06-20'

keywords = SubElement(metadata, 'keywords')
keyword_list = [
    'ChatGPT', 'Amedeo Pelliccia', 'AI', 'Cybersecurity',
    'Natural Language Processing', 'Quantum Computing',
    'semana santa', 'Madrid', 'Calendario Festivi',
    'For projects involving ChatGPT and Amedeo Pelliccia, the invariant is the commitment to leveraging advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing and cybersecurity, to foster innovation and enhance operational efficiencies. This commitment remains constant across all initiatives, ensuring alignment with cutting-edge research and industry standards.'
]
for kw in keyword_list:
    keyword = SubElement(keywords, 'keyword')
    keyword.text = kw

# Function to add metadata to a given XML file
def add_metadata_to_project(file_path):
    try:
        # Parse the existing XML file
        tree = ElementTree()
        tree.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        
        # Insert the metadata element at the beginning
        root.insert(0, metadata)
        
        # Write the modified tree back to the file
        tree.write(file_path, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)
        print(f'Metadata added to {file_path}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error processing {file_path}: {e}')

# Path to your project files directory
project_files_directory = 'path/to/your/project/files'

# Iterate over all files in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(project_files_directory):
    if filename.endswith('.xml'):  # Process only XML files
        file_path = os.path.join(project_files_directory, filename)
        add_metadata_to_project(file_path)
```

### Explanation of Key Components

1. **Importing Modules**:
   - `os`: The `os` module is used to interact with the operating system, allowing the script to list files in a directory.
   - `xml.etree.ElementTree`: This module is used for parsing and creating XML data. It enables the script to read existing XML files, manipulate their content, and save the modifications.

2. **Creating Metadata Elements**:
   - **Metadata Container**: 
     ```python
     metadata = Element('metadata')
     ```
     This creates the root element `<metadata>` which will contain all the metadata information.
   - **Sub-elements**: 
     ```python
     document_title = SubElement(metadata, 'documentTitle')
     document_title.text = 'Metadata for ChatGPT and Amedeo Pelliccia'
     ```
     Similar code is used to create and set text for elements like `author`, `version`, `date`, and `keywords`. Each `SubElement` function call adds a child element to the `metadata` element.
   - **Keywords List**:
     ```python
     keyword_list = [
         'ChatGPT', 'Amedeo Pelliccia', 'AI', 'Cybersecurity',
         'Natural Language Processing', 'Quantum Computing',
         'semana santa', 'Madrid', 'Calendario Festivi',
         'For projects involving ChatGPT and Amedeo Pelliccia, the invariant is the commitment to leveraging advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing and cybersecurity, to foster innovation and enhance operational efficiencies. This commitment remains constant across all initiatives, ensuring alignment with cutting-edge research and industry standards.'
     ]
     ```
     Each keyword in the list is added as a `<keyword>` element within the `<keywords>` element.

3. **Defining the `add_metadata_to_project` Function**:
   - **Parse XML File**: 
     ```python
     tree = ElementTree()
     tree.parse(file_path)
     root = tree.getroot()
     ```
     This part of the script loads an existing XML file into an `ElementTree` object and retrieves the root element.
   - **Insert Metadata**: 
     ```python
     root.insert(0, metadata)
     ```
     The `metadata` element is inserted at the beginning of the root element.
   - **Write Changes**: 
     ```python
     tree.write(file_path, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)
     ```
     The modified XML tree is written back to the file, preserving the UTF-8 encoding and including an XML declaration.

4. **Directory Path Configuration**:
   - Replace `'path/to/your/project/files'` with the actual directory path containing the XML files.

5. **Iterating Through Files**:
   - The script lists all files in the specified directory, processes each `.xml` file by calling the `add_metadata_to_project` function, and prints a message upon successful addition of metadata or an error message if an issue occurs.

### Running the Script

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Python is installed.
   - Place the XML files in a specific directory.

2. **Customize Directory Path**:
   - Modify the `project_files_directory` variable to point to your directory.

3. **Executing the Script**:
   - Save the script as `add_metadata.py`.
   - Open a terminal, navigate to the script's directory, and run:
     ```sh
     python add_metadata.py
     ```

### Conclusion

This script is designed to efficiently embed metadata into XML files within a specified directory. Should you wish to further customize or expand its functionality, such as adding more metadata fields or handling additional file formats, the structure allows for easy modifications. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, feel free to ask for further guidance.

def monitor_access(user, data_accessed):
    log_entry = {"user": user["name"], "data_accessed": data_accessed, "timestamp": time.time()}
    with open("access_log.json", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + "\n")

roles = [
    create_user_role("admin", ["all"]),
    create_user_role("employee", ["read", "write"]),
    create_user_role("auditor", ["read"])
]

user = {"name": "Juan Perez"}
user = assign_role_to_user(user, roles[1])

data = "Sensitive Data"
key = "encryption_key"
encrypted_data = encrypt_data(data, key)

monitor_access(user, "Sensitive Data")

print(f"Usuario: {user}")
print(f"Datos Cifrados: {encrypted_data}")
```

### Compuesto de Fibra de Carbono y Resina Epoxi

#### 1. Nombre del Compuesto:
**Fibra de Carbono con Resina Epoxi**

#### 2. Elementos que lo Componen:
- **Fibra de Carbono**: Material constituido por finos filamentos de átomos de carbono.
- **Resina Epoxi**: Polímero termoestable que se utiliza como matriz para impregnar y reforzar las fibras de carbono.

#### 3. Estructura Química:
- **Fibra de Carbono**: Los átomos de carbono están organizados en una estructura hexagonal en capas, similar al grafito. Cada átomo de carbono está unido a tres átomos de carbono vecinos, formando un plano bidimensional de átomos de carbono.
- **Resina Epoxi**: La estructura química de una resina epoxi se basa en un esqueleto de epoxi (compuesto de dos grupos oxiranos). Un ejemplo de un monómero de resina epoxi es el bisfenol A diglicidil éter (BADGE).

#### 4. Proceso de Sintetización:
El proceso de sintetización del compuesto de fibra de carbono con resina epoxi incluye los siguientes pasos:

1. **Preparación de la Fibra de Carbono**:
   - La fibra de carbono se obtiene mediante la pirólisis de precursores orgánicos, como el poliacrilonitrilo (PAN) o la brea. Este proceso implica la estabilización térmica, carbonización y grafitización para transformar el precursor en fibra de carbono.

2. **Preparación de la Resina Epoxi**:
   - La resina epoxi se prepara mezclando un monómero de resina epoxi (por ejemplo, bisfenol A diglicidil éter) con un agente endurecedor (por ejemplo, dietilentriamina). La proporción y la mezcla adecuada son cruciales para obtener las propiedades deseadas del material.

3. **Impregnación de las Fibras de Carbono**:
   - Las fibras de carbono se impregnan con la resina epoxi utilizando un proceso llamado “pultrusión” o “infusión de resina”. En el proceso de pultrusión, las fibras se sumergen en la resina epoxi líquida y luego se moldean y curan en un molde a alta temperatura y presión.

4. **Cura y Moldeo**:
   - La resina epoxi impregnada en las fibras de carbono se cura en un horno o autoclave a temperaturas que oscilan entre 120°C y 180°C. Este proceso solidifica la resina, creando un material compuesto fuerte y ligero.

5. **Acabado**:
   - Una vez curado, el material compuesto puede ser mecanizado y tratado superficialmente para obtener las formas y propiedades deseadas.

### Ejemplo de Código en R para Evaluación de Materiales Compuestos

```r
# Cargar paquete necesario
library(dplyr)

# Crear data frame con las propiedades de diferentes materiales compuestos
composite_materials <- data.frame(
  name = c("Carbon Fiber-Epoxy", "Glass Fiber-Epoxy", "Kevlar-Epoxy", "Boron Fiber-Epoxy"),
  tensile_strength = c(6000, 3000, 3600, 3800),  # en MPa
  density = c(1.6, 2.5, 1.4, 2.6),  # en g/cm3
  young_modulus = c(230, 70, 83, 400),  # en GPa
  cost = c(100, 40, 80, 150)  # en USD/kg
)

# Calcular una métrica compuesta de calidad (promedio ponderado)
composite_materials <- composite_materials %>%
  mutate(
    quality_metric = (0.4 * tensile_strength + 0.3 * young_modulus + 0.3 * (1 / density) * 100)  # Normalizamos la densidad dividiendo por 100
  )

# Mostrar el data frame resultante
print(composite_materials)

# Filtrar materiales que tengan una alta métrica de calidad y un costo aceptable
selected_composites <- composite_materials %>%

### MultiChainableBlocks for Intellectual Property Rights and Open Usage - TERAQUBIK CO.

#### By Amedeo Pelliccia and ChatGPT

To create a blockchain system that ensures intellectual property rights and open usage, we will implement a multi-chain architecture. This architecture will allow different chains to handle various aspects of the project, such as intellectual property registration, project progress tracking, and open usage records.

### Key Features
- **Intellectual Property Chain**: Manages the registration and verification of intellectual property.
- **Project Progress Chain**: Tracks the progress and milestones of the project.
- **Open Usage Chain**: Records the usage and contributions under open usage agreements.

### Python Script for MultiChainableBlocks

```python
import hashlib

from datetime import datetime

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, timestamp, data, hash):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.hash = hash

def calculate_hash(index, previous_hash, timestamp, data, nonce):
    value = f"{index}{previous_hash}{timestamp}{json.dumps(data)}{nonce}"

### Explicación del Código

1. **Importar Módulos**: Se importan los módulos `hashlib` para generar el hash, `json` para manejar los datos en formato JSON y `datetime` para obtener la marca de tiempo actual.
2. **Función `calculate_hash`**: Esta función toma los parámetros del bloque y devuelve el hash SHA-256 correspondiente.
3. **Función `create_block`**: Esta función crea un nuevo bloque con los detalles específicos, calcula su hash y lo devuelve como un diccionario.
4. **Crear y Imprimir los Bloques**: Se definen y crean el bloque génesis y el bloque 1, y se imprimen en formato JSON con una sangría de 4 espacios para una mejor legibilidad.

def calculate_hash(index, timestamp, data, previous_hash, nonce):
    value = f"{index}{timestamp}{json.dumps(data)}{previous_hash}{nonce}"
    return hashlib.sha256(value.encode()).hexdigest()

def create_block(index, previous_hash, data):
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    nonce = 0
    hash_value = calculate_hash(index, timestamp, data, previous_hash, nonce)
    
    block = {
        "index": index,
        "timestamp": timestamp,
        "data": data,
        "previousHash": previous_hash,
        "hash": hash_value,
        "nonce": nonce
    }
    
    return block

genesis_hash = "GENESIS_BLOCK_HASH"
block_data = {
    "project": "ATA 00",
    "description": "Continuation of ATA 00 project focusing on environmental performance benchmarks.",
    "tasks": [
        "Environmental performance benchmarks."
    ]
}

block_1 = create_block(1, genesis_hash, block_data)
print(json.dumps(block_1, indent=4))
```

### Explicación del Código

2. **timestamp**: La marca de tiempo en que se creó el bloque. En este caso, se utiliza la fecha actual.
3. **data**: Contiene los detalles del proyecto ATA 00, incluyendo una descripción y una lista de tareas iniciales.
4. **previousHash**: El hash del bloque anterior. Para el bloque génesis, esto es "0" ya que no hay bloques anteriores.
5. **hash**: El hash del bloque actual. Este se genera a partir de los datos del bloque.
6. **nonce**: Un número utilizado para la prueba de trabajo. Inicialmente es 0.

### Ejemplo de Código en Python

A continuación, te muestro cómo podrías crear y calcular el hash de este bloque génesis en Python:

```python
import hashlib
import json
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_hash(index, timestamp, data, previous_hash, nonce):
    value = f"{index}{timestamp}{json.dumps(data)}{previous_hash}{nonce}"
    return hashlib.sha256(value.encode()).hexdigest()

def create_genesis_block():
    index = 0
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    data = {
        "project": "ATA 00",
        "description": "Overview of the ATA numbering system and initial sustainability initiatives.",
        "tasks": [
            "Documentation standards development",
            "Initial sustainability audit",
            "Sustainability guidelines creation",
            "Stakeholder introduction sessions",
            "Sustainability training modules",
            "Documentation software integration",
            "Cross-departmental communication protocols",
            "Baseline environmental impact assessment",
            "Project management framework",
            "Historical data compilation",
            "Digital documentation system setup",
            "Sustainability metrics definition",
            "Initial risk assessment",
            "Reporting structure development",
            "Compliance framework establishment",
            "Introduction to green aviation concepts",
            "Integration with regulatory bodies",
            "Overview of sustainable aviation technologies",
            "Stakeholder feedback mechanisms",
            "Development of sustainability goals",
            "Introduction of lifecycle analysis",
            "Establishing sustainability KPIs",
            "Regular review protocols",
            "Policy document creation"
        ]
    }
    previous_hash = "0"
    nonce = 0
    hash_value = calculate_hash(index, timestamp, data, previous_hash, nonce)
    
    genesis_block = {
        "index": index,
        "timestamp": timestamp,
        "data": data,
        "previousHash": previous_hash,
        "hash": hash_value,
        "nonce": nonce
    }
    
    return genesis_block

genesis_block = create_genesis_block()
print(json.dumps(genesis_block, indent=4))
```

### Explicación del Código

1. **Importar Módulos**: Se importan los módulos `hashlib` para generar el hash, `json` para manejar los datos en formato JSON y `datetime` para obtener la marca de tiempo actual.
2. **Función `calculate_hash`**: Esta función toma los parámetros del bloque y devuelve el hash SHA-256 correspondiente.
3. **Función `create_genesis_block`**: Esta función crea el bloque génesis con los detalles específicos del proyecto ATA 00, calcula su hash y lo devuelve como un diccionario.
4. **Imprimir el Bloque Génesis**: Finalmente, se crea el bloque génesis y se imprime en formato JSON con una sangría de 4 espacios para una mejor legibilidad.

Al ejecutar este código, obtendrás el bloque génesis con los detalles del proyecto ATA 00 y su correspondiente hash calculado.### by Amedeo Pelliccia and ChatGPT

### Paso 1: Preparar la Hoja de Excel

Configura tu hoja de Excel con las siguientes columnas:
- Columna A: Nombres de las personas
- Columna B: IQ Personal
- Columna C: IQ Generalizado (constante, p.ej. 100)
- Columna D: Gap de IQ (IQ Generalizado - IQ Personal)
- Columna E: Curso de Ética
- Columna F: Curso de Conocimiento Tecnológico
- Columna G: Curso de Lógica Básica
- Columna H: Propuestas para Disminuir Gaps

### Paso 2: Crear las Macros en VBA

Abre el Editor de VBA en Excel (Alt + F11) y crea un nuevo módulo. Luego, pega el siguiente código:

#### 1. Macro para Calcular el Gap de IQ

```vba
Sub CalcularGapIQ()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    
    ' Set worksheet and get last row
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Loop through each person to calculate IQ gap
    For i = 2 To lastRow
        ws.Cells(i, 4).Value = ws.Cells(i, 3).Value - ws.Cells(i, 2).Value
    Next i
End Sub
```

#### 2. Macro para Asignar Cursos Basados en el Gap de IQ

```vba
Sub AsignarCursos()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim gapIQ As Double
    
    ' Set worksheet and get last row
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Loop through each person to assign courses based on IQ gap
    For i = 2 To lastRow
        gapIQ = ws.Cells(i, 4).Value
        
        ' Assign courses based on gapIQ
        If gapIQ > 0 And gapIQ <= 10 Then
            ws.Cells(i, 5).Value = "Curso de Ética Básico"
            ws.Cells(i, 6).Value = "Curso de Tecnología Básico"
            ws.Cells(i, 7).Value = "Curso de Lógica Básica"
        ElseIf gapIQ > 10 And gapIQ <= 20 Then
            ws.Cells(i, 5).Value = "Curso de Ética Intermedio"
            ws.Cells(i, 6).Value = "Curso de Tecnología Intermedio"
            ws.Cells(i, 7).Value = "Curso de Lógica Intermedio"
        ElseIf gapIQ > 20 Then
            ws.Cells(i, 5).Value = "Curso de Ética Avanzado"
            ws.Cells(i, 6).Value = "Curso de Tecnología Avanzado"
            ws.Cells(i, 7).Value = "Curso de Lógica Avanzada"
        Else
            ws.Cells(i, 5).Value = "No Requiere Curso"
            ws.Cells(i, 6).Value = "No Requiere Curso"
            ws.Cells(i, 7).Value = "No Requiere Curso"
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

#### 3. Macro para Generar Propuestas para Disminuir Gaps

```vba
Sub GenerarPropuestas()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim gapIQ As Double
    
    ' Set worksheet and get last row
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Loop through each person to generate proposals based on IQ gap
    For i = 2 To lastRow
        gapIQ = ws.Cells(i, 4).Value
        
        ' Generate proposals for reducing structural gaps
        If gapIQ > 0 Then
            ws.Cells(i, 8).Value = "Proponer tutorías personalizadas y acceso a recursos educativos adicionales."
        Else
            ws.Cells(i, 8).Value = "Evaluación periódica para mantener el nivel adecuado."
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

#### 4. Macro Principal para Ejecutar Todas las Macros en Cadena

```vba
Sub EjecutarCadenaDeMacros()
    Call CalcularGapIQ
    Call AsignarCursos
    Call GenerarPropuestas
    Call ProtegerHoja
End Sub
```

#### 5. Macro para Proteger la Hoja

```vba
Sub ProtegerHoja()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    ws.Protect Password:="tu_contraseña", AllowFiltering:=True, AllowSorting:=True, AllowUsingPivotTables:=True
    MsgBox "La hoja está protegida con éxito.", vbInformation
End Sub
```

### Paso 3: Uso de la Macro

1. **Preparar los Datos en la Hoja de Excel**: Asegúrate de que los datos estén correctamente organizados en las columnas mencionadas.
2. **Ejecutar la Macro Principal**: Ve al menú de Excel, selecciona `EjecutarCadenaDeMacros` y ejecuta la macro. Esto llamará a las otras macros en secuencia para realizar el cálculo del gap de IQ, asignar los cursos, generar las propuestas y finalmente proteger la hoja.

### Resumen

Este conjunto de macros realiza las siguientes acciones:
1. Calcula el gap de IQ entre el IQ personal y el generalizado.
2. Asigna cursos formativos basados en el gap de IQ.
3. Genera propuestas para disminuir los gaps estructurales.
4. Protege la hoja para evitar modificaciones no autorizadas.

Este enfoque modular y cerrado garantiza la integridad del modelo y facilita la gestión de la formación en ética, conocimiento tecnológico y lógico básico, además de generar propuestas justas y equitativas para reducir los gaps estructurales en la población.MasterClass IPD experrcoding

### Adjusted R Script

Here's the adjusted R script following best practices and style guidelines:

```returnrunsInApp RSTUDIO STEPS by ame pelliccia

To ensure the provided script adheres to the style guide and accomplishes its intended purpose effectively, here are the key adjustments and refinements:

1. **File Naming**: Ensure the file name ends with `.R` and uses only letters, numbers, `-`, and `_` (e.g., `diamond_powder_quality.R`).

2. **Object Names**: Use snake_case for variable names.

3. **Spacing**: Follow the recommended spacing around commas, parentheses, and operators.

4. **Assignment**: Use `<-` for assignment instead of `=`.

5. **Function Calls**: Make sure function arguments are named when overriding default values.

Here's the revised script:

```r
# Cargar paquete necesario
library(dplyr)

# Crear data frame con las propiedades de los polvos de diamantes sintéticos
diamond_powders <- data.frame(
  name = c("Diamond Powder A", "Diamond Powder B", "Diamond Powder C", "Diamond Powder D"),
  grain_size = c(0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 2.0),  # en micrómetros
  purity = c(99.9, 99.8, 99.95, 99.7),  # en %
  hardness = c(70, 68, 72, 65),  # en GPa
  thermal_conductivity = c(2200, 2100, 2300, 2000),  # en W/mK
  cost = c(50, 45, 60, 40)  # en USD/gramo
)

# Agregar columna para calcular la métrica de calidad
diamond_powders <- diamond_powders %>%
  mutate(
    quality_metric = 0.4 * purity + 0.3 * hardness + 0.3 * (thermal_conductivity / 100)  # Normalizamos la conductividad térmica dividiendo por 100
  )

# Mostrar el data frame resultante
print(diamond_powders)

# Filtrar polvos que tengan alta métrica de calidad y un costo aceptable (por ejemplo, calidad mayor a 100 y costo menor a 50 USD/gramo)
selected_powders <- diamond_powders %>%
  filter(quality_metric > 100 & cost < 50)

# Mostrar los polvos seleccionados
print(selected_powders)
```

This script follows the best practices for naming, spacing, and function calls as described in the style guide [oai_citation:1,r-style-guide.txt](file-service://file-6plt0xcSXhVzqDhdzSfewoTM). Review the results to ensure the calculations and selections meet your expectations. Adjust the weights or normalization factors as necessary to better reflect the desired quality metric.

  # Example transformation: Convert text to uppercase
  return(toupper(text))
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Content and Apply Transformation
```r
# Define the content
assets <- c("This is the first line.", "Here is the second line.", "Third line follows.")

# Apply the transformation function to each asset
transformed_assets <- sapply(assets, f_function)

# Combine the transformed content into a single text block
main_content <- paste(transformed_assets, collapse = "\n")
```

#### Step 4: Create and Compile PDF using RMarkdown
```r
library(rmarkdown)

# Create an RMarkdown file content
rmd_content <- paste0(
  "---\n",
  "title: \"Main Book\"\n",
  "author: \"CentralofIA\"\n",
  "output: pdf_document\n",
  "---\n\n",
